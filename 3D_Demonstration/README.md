# 3D Demonstration

This python file was first used to build the algorithm, and move the motors through Arduino. I have since switched to the STM so all Arduino and Serial lines are commented, but still used the Python code interface to validate my calculation.

I am now using it as a graphical demonstration to how the system works.
